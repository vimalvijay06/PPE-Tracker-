# PPE-Tracker-
It allows adding employees, issuing PPE, tracking lifespan, and checking for expired safety gear to ensure workplace safety.

Problem Statement:
  in industries such as construction,manufacturing, and healthcare, safety gear(PPE) has a limited lifecycle.

Challenge faced in this are  workers using the expired gloves and helmets.
they track the expire dates in the note it is risky and some files are missed this may cause the major lose for the workers safety


CONSOLE:
   The oops concepts used in this are encapsulation , abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism.
   in encapsulation we use the private atributes (gearID, name,expiryDate)
   in the polymorphism we use the checkExpiry() functions for the multiple time
   in the inheritance subclassed (helmet,gloves,vest) inherit from the parent PPE class
